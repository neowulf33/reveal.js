            ## Overview
            * Introduction
            * Traditional Concurrency Model
                * Pitfalls of Traditional Concurrency Model
                * Updated JDK API
            * Dealing With State
                * Three different types of dealing with state
            * Resources
            * Questions

            Note:
            * Not a session about how to program concurrency
            * Take bigger picture
            * Will give pointers and introduce new techniques / technologies
                * Some models which will allow you to tackle multithreading models
                * Hopefully, you will keep some of the points when writing your next Java method

            ## Introduction
            * Single thread, single execution flow
                * Underutilizes the multi core processors
            * We want to increase the efficiency of the overall process by making them parallel tasks

                ## Introduction
                ### Benefits
                * Makes apps more responsive
                * Reduce latency
                * Increase throughput

                ## Introduction
                ### Limitations
                * Starvation
                * Deadlock
                * Race Conditions

                Note:
                * Starvation
                * MySQL Thread Pool
                * Application asks for confirmation before performing a critical task
                * Thread is dependent on external event to occur or for another thread to release the lock
                * Timeouts
                * Deadlock
                * Timeouts doesn’t help – just a programmer error
                * Race Conditions
                * Two threads competing to use the same resource or data

            <section data-markdown>
                ## Traditional Concurrency Model
                * Threads are not reused as they don’t allow restart
                    * So, we create multiple threads
                * Scheduling multiple tasks on a thread
                    * Write quite a bit of extra code
                * `wait()` and `notify()` require synchronization
                * `join()` cares about the death of the thread rather than a task being accomplished
                * `synchronized` lacks granularity
                    * No time out
                * Very difficult to unit test for thread safety
            </section>
            <section data-markdown>
                ## Traditional Concurrency Model
                * Instead of using `Thread` class and its methods
                    * Use `ExecutorService` class and related classes
                * To acquire locks, use `Lock` interface and its methods
                * Instead of using `wait` / `notify`
                    * Use synchronizers such as CyclicBarrier and CountdownLatch
                * Spend some time with java.util.concurrent package
                    * Lot has changed!

                Note:
                Use higher level APIs rather than lower level `Thread` class

                * Isolated Mutability
                * Pure Immutability

                ## Dealing With State
                ### Shared Mutability - Total Age Of The Group
                * Algorithm
                    * I write 0 on the blackboard
                    * Everyone has to come up and add their age to the current value
                * Salient Points
                    * Watch out for somebody making the wrong calculation
                    * Line of people waiting for their turn to write their age
                * Programming Terms
                    * Safeguard against a rogue thread which will ruin the calculation
                    * Blocking threads
                    * High thread safety
                    * Low concurrency

                ## Dealing With State
                ### Isolated Mutability - Total Age Of The Group
                * Algorithm
                    * Everybody sends me a text message with their age
                * Salient Points
                    * Nobody has to wait
                        * Senders are concurrent and non-blocking
                    * The mutable value which is the total age is isolated
                        * Only I hold the value, nobody else has access to that value
                    * Cell phone carrier took care of the concurrency for me
                * Programming Terms
                    * Every person including myself was a thread (actor)
                    * The message itself was immutable, I only get a copy of the message.
                    * Values within the actor are isolated and cannot be viewed by other actors
                    * No need to worry about synchronization
            </section>

                ## Dealing With State
                ### Pure Immutability - Total Age Of The Group
                * Algorithm
                    * Everyone sits in a circle
                    * First person will tell her age to the person sitting on the left
                    * Second person will total his age to the value given
                    * Then, give the new total to the person sitting on the left
                    * Repeat until all people have been processed
                * Salient Points
                    * Nobody has changed any value
                    * Large groups of people can be partitioned into smaller groups (MapReduce approach)
                * Programming Terms
                    * Very common in functional languages such as Scala, Clojure, Groovy, and JRuby
                    * Different programming paradigm
                    * Algorithms need to favor immutability, apply recursive structure / functional composition, and utilize persistent data structures.

                Notes:
                * Nobody has changed any value
                * Every person had a new partial total and created a new total
                * Old values were discarded

                * Recursion was tough for me

                ## Dealing With State
                * How would a wiki page be collaborated?
                    * Shared Mutability
                    * Isolated Mutability
                    * Pure Immutability

                Note:
                * Single wiki page needs to be collaborated
                    * Shared Mutability – Single page
                    * Isolated Mutability – Different sections of the page are given to different people. Section when completed is given to a co-ordinator who will guard the final page.
                    * Pure Immutability – Single page, but a sequential chain of people are working on the page

                ## Shared Mutability
                * Copying from local / working memory (registers / caches) to main memory
                    * Write has to happen before the read
                    * Writing thread has to cross the memory barrier before the reading thread
                * APIs which force crossing the memory barrier
                    * `synchronized` / `volatile` keywords force – changes to be globally visible
                    * Methods such as `Thread.start()` and `Threads.interrupt()`
                    * `ExecutorService`
                    * `CountdownLatch`
                    
                Note: 
                * Memory Barrier
                    * Threads from constructors forces memory barrier because start() is called.

                ## Shared Mutability
                ### Concerns
                * Not restricted to public fields
                    * Shared variable is accessed, for read or write, by more than one thread.
                * Common mistakes
                    * Don’t create threads from within constructors; instead, create them in static factory methods.
                        * Exposes partially created objects to other threads.
                    * Don’t create arbitrary threads; instead use a pool of threads to reduce the tasks startup time and resource use.
                    * Ensure that access to mutable fields cross **memory barrier** and are visible to threads properly.
                    * Evaluate the granularity of locks and promote concurrency to be at the right level.
                    * When working with multiple mutable fields, verify that the access to these variables is atomic; that is other threads don’t see partial changes to these fields.
                    
                Note:
                * Threads from constructors forces memory barrier because start() is called.

                ## Shared Mutability
                ### Concerns
                * Synchronization
                    * Blocking threads – waiting
                    * Locks need to be fine grained / granular
                        * Easy to create deadlock
                        * Maybe need to retry getting the lock as the operation failed or lock acquisition failed
                * An alternative approach is to use Software Transactional Memory

                ## Shared Mutability
                ### Software Transaction Memory
                * STM provides transactional like facilities
                * Create transactions around mutating code
                    * No explicit locks
                * If no conflicts with other transactions / threads, transaction is completed, committed to memory
                    * Otherwise, transaction is reverted.
                * Nested transactions
                * Read only transactions
                * Blocking transactions
                * Commit and rollback

            <section data-markdown>
                ## Shared Mutability
                ### Software Transaction Memory
                * ACID like properties without the Durability
                    * Atomicity
                        * All or none 
                * Consistency
                    * Transactions complete till the end. Other transactions will consistently see one change after the other.
                * Isolation
                    * Transactions don’t see partial changes of other transactions but only after a transaction is completed.

                ## Shared Mutability
                ### Software Transaction Memory
                * Lock-free programming model
                    * No need to worry about lock order
                * Ok, so what is the problem?
                    * Suitable only when write collisions are infrequent (like MySql)

                ## Isolated Mutability
                ### Introduction
                * JDK Threading API
                * Software Transactional Memory (STM)
                    * Still painful
                    * Doesn’t manage mutable variables for you
                * Event-Based Message Passing

            <section data-markdown>
                ## Isolated Mutability
                ### Event-Based Message Passing
                * Create tasks as lightweight processes
                * Send immutable messages to the task
                * Once completed, pass back the result or to other coordinating tasks
                * Messages
                    * Asynchronous / Synchronous
                * `Tasks == Actors`
                    * `Actors != Threads`
                    * Actors are scheduled on Threads
            </section>
            <section data-markdown>
                ## Isolated Mutability
                ### Actors
                * `numberOf(actors) != numberOf(threads)`
                * Actor per entity
                * In-built message queue just like a cell phone
                * Actor scheduler
                    * `Threads` are like `Cafeteria Seats`
                    *  `Actors` are like `Office Employees`                
            </section>
            <section data-markdown>
                ## Isolated Mutability
                ### Actors
                * Ensure messages are immutable
                * Actors run asynchronously but coordinate by passing messages.
                    * Actor starvation – waiting for messages which never arrive
                * Actors do not prevent deadlock
                    * Two actors waiting on one another for messages
                * Actors can handle one message at a time
